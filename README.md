uhh how the f do you format this thing

just follow the 2nd answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50095522/how-to-get-whole-facebook-friends-list-from-api
get two jsons, and one will have the friends removed obviously then wait i forgot lemme check my code 
okay so on line 24 on removed_objects = get_removed_objects('friendsList.json', 'friendsList copy.json') just paste your two jsons into the same folder as the Main.py and then make sure that it matches or something idk how to english

then just run lol it should show who unadded you lmao xd

too much trouble? unforunately fb doesn't have an api for the friend list xdddddddddddd
